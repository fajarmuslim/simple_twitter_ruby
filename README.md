# Simple Twitter Ruby

### Scope:
Your application will be an API-only application with the following stories:
1. As a user, I want to save my username, email, and bio description.
* Authentication and authorization is out of scope of this story and you donâ€™t need to implement them
2. As a user, I want to post a text that might contain hashtag(s).
* Maximum limit of a text is 1000 characters
* A hashtag is a text that is followed by # symbol, for instance: #generasigigih
3. As a user, I want to see all posts that contain a certain hashtag.
* A user can only filter by one hashtag at a time
4. As a user, I want to see the list of trending hashtags.
* Trending hashtags are the top 5 most posted hashtags in the past 24 hours
* A post containing multiple instances of a hashtag only counts as 1 occurrence for trending hashtags calculation
5. As a user, I want to comment on a post
* A comment can contain hashtag(s)
* A hashtag occurrence in a comment is counted in trending hashtags calculation
